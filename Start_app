npx create-react-app frontend
npm install react-scripts@latest
cd frontend
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest

npx tsc --init

after init in the tsconfig.json file i had added in the 
compailerOptions{
'jsx':"react"
}

and also add exclude outside the compailerOption

  "exclude": [
    "node_modules",
    "build",
    "App.test.tsx" // Add this line to exclude App.test.ts
  ]
